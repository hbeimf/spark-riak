### An honest disclaimer

Due to our obsession with stability and our rich ecosystem of users, community updates on this repo may take a little longer to review. 

The most helpful way to contribute is by reporting your experience through issues. Issues may not be updated while we review internally, but they're still incredibly appreciated.

Thank you for being part of the community! We love you for it. 

## Helping through sample code

The most immediately helpful way you can benefit this project is by using the Riak Spark Connector in your own application and providing examples to the community detailing how you use it. Open an issue in this repository and we may be able to use your sample code in the `RiakClientExamples` project.

## How-to contribute to the Riak Spark Connector

**_IMPORTANT_**: This is an open source project licensed under the Apache 2.0 License. We encourage contributions to the project from the community. We ask that you keep in mind these considerations when planning your contribution.

* Whether your contribution is for a bug fix or a feature request, **create an [Issue](https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/issues)** and let us know what you are thinking.
* **For bugs**, if you have already found a fix, feel free to submit a Pull Request referencing the Issue you created.
* **For feature requests**, we want to improve upon the library incrementally which means small changes at a time. In order ensure your PR can be reviewed in a timely manner, please keep PRs small, e.g. <10 files and <500 lines changed. If you think this is unrealistic, then mention that within the Issue and we can discuss it.

Once you're ready to contribute code back to this repo, start with these steps: 

* Fork the appropriate sub-projects that are affected by your change. 
* Create a topic branch for your change and checkout that branch.
     `git checkout -b some-topic-branch`
     * Make your changes and run the test suite if one is provided. (see below)
     * Commit your changes and push them to your fork.
     * Open pull-requests for the appropriate projects.
     * Contributors will review your pull request, suggest changes, and merge it when itâ€™s ready and/or offer feedback.
     * To report a bug or issue, please open a new issue against this repository.
